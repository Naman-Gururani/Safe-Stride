# Safe-Stride
Safe Stride is a "One Stop" solution for ensuring elderly safety, which uses Geolocation to track the user's location and accelerometer readings to detect falls. It shows the user's live location on a map and provides an emergency alert feature that sends an SMS to a predefined number in case of a fall.

## Project Description

The Save Stride is a web application that allows users to track the live location of an individual and detect falls in real-time. The system uses geolocation services to track the user's location and a device's accelerometer to detect falls. When the system detects a fall, it triggers an emergency alert and sends an SMS to a pre-configured contact. The web application includes a dashboard that displays the user's live location and an emergency alert trigger that displays the user's current location and acceleration magnitude. The system uses Leaflet, a popular open-source JavaScript library, to display the user's location on a map. The system is designed to be simple and easy to use, with a minimalistic interface that enables users to quickly access the information they need. Overall, the Fall Detection System is an effective tool for monitoring the well-being of individuals who are at risk of falls, such as the elderly or people with disabilities.
